\section{Background and Purpose} % (fold)
\label{sec:background}
Throughout this course, you have been creating Outcomes Memos designed to highlight your progress toward the course outcomes as you completed each major assignment. Those memos were practice for this audit, which reflects your overall progress. Consider what you have learned both explicitly through your reading and intrinsically through your work. Be sure to think about the research process and the types of writing it involves. What is your current understanding of the research process? How well did you do with the outcomes of the course? What have you learned this semester, even if it wasn't expected (by you or me)?

Step back from your assignments and look at the ``big picture'' of the course. Review the Course Syllabus to recall how your assignments were designed to fit together. Then, \textbf{write a letter to your instructor asserting how well you achieved the course outcomes.} The letter format affords more casual language than a formal essay, but it constrains you to a smaller number of pages. Consider what you think is worth emphasizing about your experiences this term.%\footnote{I plan to spend a few minutes in class brainstorming other affordances and constraints for the letter format. I'd also like to get my students to come up with either an organizational structure or an include/exclude list for content.}

\section{Procedure} % (fold)
\label{sec:procedure}
\begin{description}
	\item[Brainstorm] Review the course outcomes listed on the syllabus. Which of the outcomes have you accomplished this semester? What did you do this semester that proves you met those goals?
	\item[Organize] Find specific examples of each course outcome in the material you have created for this class.
	\item[Write] Draft a letter that explains how you met the outcomes and refers to the examples you came up with. This letter will be read by your instructor and possibly by a program assessment committee from the Department of Writing and Rhetoric. In other words, your audience is familiar with the expectations and terminology used in Comp II at \textsc{ucf}. You should refer to the expectations and use the terminology, rather than taking time to define them.
	\item[Revise] Double-check your document organization and goals. Make sure you address each outcome and support yourself with specific, convincing evidence. If you claimed that this course or your instructor has completely changed your life or made you the Bestest. Writer. Evar\texttrademark{}, please revise. This document is not designed to inflate my ego or earn you an A. Instead, it exists to show me where to find evidence that you've achieved the course's goals. Stay focused.
	\item[Compile] Assemble all the supporting material to prove your case. At a minimum, you should include revised versions of the major assignments\footnote{The version of this document distributed in class incorrectly stated three assignments and did not account for the revised Research Proposal.} you have already completed (Research Proposals\footnote{Include both your original proposal guiding the work you did this semester and the revised report setting up future research} and the Primary, Secondary, and Academic Research Reports). If any minor assignments or other material helps illustrates that you achieved the course outcomes, include them, as well.
%	\item[Include] This Course Audit is part of your Final Portfolio. Include it as a form of cover sheet, then add the material you compiled in the previous step.
%	\item[Relax] Smile, knowing there's nothing else you have to do for this class.

\section{Evaluation} % (fold)
\label{sec:rubric}
%This assignment is not designed to evaluate your ability to kiss up to your instructor and claim that the class has immeasurably changed your life for the better. 
The focus of the assignment is to get you to take a broad view of the content and goals of the course. If you are able to address the course content and comment on your experiences within it, you will have done your job. The rubric included in Table~\ref{tab:rubric} provides evaluation details.
